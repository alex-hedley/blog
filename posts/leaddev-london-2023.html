        <!-- LeadDev London 2023 -->
<p>This week I had the absolute pleasure of going to <a href="https://leaddev.com/leaddev-london-2023">LeadDev London 2023</a> thanks to my employer Opencast.</p>
<p>🗓️ June 27–28, 2023
🏟️ barbican</p>
<p>It was my first time at this event and I'd heard great things for current colleagues who have been over the years and friends I'd mentioned I was going too.</p>
<p>I liked the fact that there was just a single track each day, I didn't have to make a choice of which talks to go to and get FOMO or regret missing any after hearing other peoples thoughts.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://leaddev.com/leaddev-london/agenda-2023">Agenda</a></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Key Points</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>F**king NASA</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://leaddev.com/code-conduct">Code Of Conduct</a> - Don't be a d**k</p>
</li>
<li><p>#LeadDevLondon - Capitalise - helps with screen readers and accessibility</p>
</li>
<li><p>Live captions throughout.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It felt a very safe and inclusive space.</p>
<p>Two speakers I was told to keep an eye out for were Nickolas Means and Clare Sudbery and they didn't disappoint.</p>
<p>One stand out presentation was from Jason Wodicka on <strong>Engineering a more equitable hiring process</strong>. They absolutely commanded the stage and the message was a very important one.</p>
<p>I also have to mention Sinéad Cummings with <strong>Parents who code: How to welcome your developers back after parental leave</strong> not just because she is a great friend and colleague but because this was another very overlooked subject and isn't just applicable to Parents but anyone who needs time off.</p>
<p>I also managed to grab a load of swag! Sorted for socks and teeshirts for a while :).</p>
