<!-- Markdown -->

Work offer the opportunity to present within our Communities. One I chose to do was [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) to our UCD community.

The idea is to build up a few key skills in stages, first show markdown, then git and make them all into developers :p.
Roles are always expecting so much more cross discipline skills and I thought it would be good to to a talk that gave an intro to this.

Originally it was done as a PowerPoint presentation but I'm now moving [revealjs](https://revealjs.com).
