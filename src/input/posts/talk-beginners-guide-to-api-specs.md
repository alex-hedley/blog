<!-- Beginners Guide to API Specs - Part 1 -->

I work in cross discipline teams and the Product Delivery members keep us Developers on track, writing up User Stories, managing our ceremonies etc. We often talk a lot about APIs and it's prob not something they are interested in :p.
This talk was to demystify a [swagger](http://swagger.io/) spec, break it down into what it is, what it does, and how we use them in our day to day jobs.
