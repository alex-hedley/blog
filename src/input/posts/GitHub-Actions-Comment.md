Have you ever needed to add a comment to your PR after your Jobs(s) have completed?

Scrolling through the logs can be long winded, why not add a nice comment?

Want to add some some cool emojis too?

- [emoji-cheat-sheet](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md)

  - ðŸ”— `:link:`
  - ðŸ“˜ `:blue_book:`
  - etc

Start with the [actions/github-script](https://github.com/actions/github-script) action.

It has various features, one of which is to `createComment`.

Add the various inputs you need to configure:

`github.issues.createComment({})`

The `body` is the piece you want to update with your info

`body: ':link: MY LINK'`

With an output of

> ðŸ”— MY LINK

Then you can set your trigger to run on a *PR* and it'll add the necessary info.
