<!-- # DotNet Newcastle Meetup - Nov 2024 -->

📅 Wednesday, November 27, 2024 · 5:30 - 8pm GMT

📍 12th Floor, Bank House, Pilgrim Street, Newcastle, NE1 6SQ

🔗 https://www.meetup.com/dotnetmeetupnorth/events/304302320/

## Talks

**Speaker 1**: Adam Parker

**Title**: Intro to Compilers with C#

**Description**:

Compilers can be very complicated and large and the famous book on them quite literally features a dragon. But what happens if you strip it back to its basics?

In this talk we will implement the many stages of compilation (in a simplified way) with a more in depth look at a parsing algorithm, all to compile simple mathematical expressions.

**Speaker Bio**:

Adam Parker has been a software developer for just over 6 years, mainly developing in the dotnet ecosystem.

**Speaker 2**: James Murphy

**Title**: Fun with Flags

**Description**:

A few thoughts relating to basic use of feature flags in .NET - some code, some tools, and some things learnt along the way.

**Speaker Bio**:

James Murphy (Murph) has been attempting to learn to write code for 45 years and feels that given another decade or two he might just get the hang of it...despite this
