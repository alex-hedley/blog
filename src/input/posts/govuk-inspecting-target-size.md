## Details

This is the second in a series of workshops focusing on the new Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 criteria, run by the GOV.UK Design System team.

T﻿his particular workshop will concentrate on the 'Target Size' criteria. Portions of the session will be recorded (presentation & demo parts), so that we can share on a wider scale after the event.

### Agenda

We will:

- Introduce WCAG and the new guidelines
- Look at the Target Size criteria in more detail
- Assess some examples to see whether they meet the criteria or fail
- Talk about strategies to resolve some of the problems we uncover

**Session type**: Interactive workshop, we will form groups to discuss examples  
**Duration**: 2 hours  
**Platform**: Zoom (please make sure your device can access Zoom meetings)  
If you sign up, please make sure you can attend the whole session, as we sell out quite quickly. The interactive part of the session is where a lot of the learning happens.
We will be using Zoom Meetings and Google Docs for notes. Please make sure you have a device that can access these, as some organisation's firewalls block these platforms.
