  - [Credly Profile](https://www.credly.com/users/alexhedley/badges)

The pass mark is 700 / 1000 and I achieved: **780**.

> The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner offers a foundational understanding of AWS Cloud concepts, services, and terminology. This is a good starting point for individuals in non-technical roles with no prior IT or cloud experience or for those with on-premises IT experience looking for basic AWS Cloud fluency. This certification can give candidates the confidence to tackle role-based AWS Certifications.

I took this in a Pearson VUE testing center instead of an online proctored exam. Don't need to worry about the internet dropping out etc.
