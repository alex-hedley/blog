### Agenda

Agenda:

- Discussion: What are you leaving behind in 2024?

**Session type**: Show & tell, discussion  
**Duration**: 1 hour  
**Platform**: Zoom (please make sure your device can access Zoom meetings)  
If you sign up, please make sure you can attend the whole session, as we sell out quite quickly.
We will be using **Zoom Meetings** for video, and **Padlet** for notes and comments. Please make sure you have a device that can access these, as some organisation’s firewalls block these platforms.
