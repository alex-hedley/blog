<!-- LeadDev London 2023 -->

This week I had the absolute pleasure of going to [LeadDev London 2023](https://leaddev.com/leaddev-london-2023) thanks to my employer Opencast.

üóìÔ∏è June 27‚Äì28, 2023
üèüÔ∏è barbican

It was my first time at this event and I'd heard great things for current colleagues who have been over the years and friends I'd mentioned I was going too.

I liked the fact that there was just a single track each day, I didn't have to make a choice of which talks to go to and get FOMO or regret missing any after hearing other peoples thoughts.

- [Agenda](https://leaddev.com/leaddev-london/agenda-2023)

*Key Points*

- F**king NASA

- [Code Of Conduct](https://leaddev.com/code-conduct) - Don't be a d**k

- #LeadDevLondon - Capitalise - helps with screen readers and accessibility

- Live captions throughout.

It felt a very safe and inclusive space.

Two speakers I was told to keep an eye out for were Nickolas Means and Clare Sudbery and they didn't disappoint.

One stand out presentation was from Jason Wodicka on **Engineering a more equitable hiring process**. They absolutely commanded the stage and the message was a very important one.

I also have to mention Sin√©ad Cummings with **Parents who code: How to welcome your developers back after parental leave** not just because she is a great friend and colleague but because this was another very overlooked subject and isn't just applicable to Parents but anyone who needs time off.

I also managed to grab a load of swag! Sorted for socks and teeshirts for a while :).
