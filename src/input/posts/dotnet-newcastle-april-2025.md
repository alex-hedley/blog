## Talks

**Speaker 1**: John Staveley

**Title**: Creating an AI assistant to help run meetups

**Description**:

In this session I will explain how I created a cheeky virtual assistant called JaaS to aid in the running of several meetups that I organise.
How I was able to interact it with it using Azure Speech to Text and Azure Text to Speech.
How I gave it almost limitless knowledge by incorporating ChatGPT using the Azure OpenAI service.
And... how once created, it did not put anyone out of a job or take over the world!

**Speaker 2**: Peter Shaw

**Title**: Using Postgres SQL With .NET

**Description**:

You can use Entity Framework, and get access to Postgres just like you can with every other database system on the planet, but what if I told you that Postgres goes way, way beyond anything you can do with entity framework. What most folks DON'T know is that Postgres touts itself as a "Data Application Framework" and with the latest version of NPG-SQL (The official Postgres driver for dotnet) you can now get access to much of this extra goodness, stick with me while I try to cram as much as I can show you in about an hour, that you probably never realised Postgres could do.

**Speaker Bio**:

Peter Shaw - I have been a dev for 30 or more years now.

I wrote my first bit of code in may 1979 at the age of 7, by the time I was 10 I was programming chip level in machine code on the Z80 & 6502 CPU's, moving into my teenage years I was programming Arm cpu's before anyone knew what they where.

I don't really sell myself, I'm a dev after all not a marketer, but there's not many areas of I.T. I've not worked in, from hardware to software, support to management.

These days I'm best known for my activities in the .NET & MS Dev scene here in the UK, My blog posts frequently appear on other outlets as well as my own blog, and if you've got the time to sit and listen to what I have to say, I've certainly got the time to tell you.

I'm a veteran of the "Developer Developer Developer" series of live developer events here in the UK, and one of the main figures behind "LiDNUG" (http://lidnug.org) on the linked in network.
