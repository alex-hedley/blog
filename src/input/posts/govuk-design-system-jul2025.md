### Agenda

- What is our current offer? monthly chat, DSDay, hacks, ad-hoc sessions
- What do you attend? Why, why not?
- What would you like to see more of? What would you actually take time to attend?
- Let's create a backlog of topics for events/workshops

**Session type**: Workshop/discusssion  
**Duration**: 1 hour  
**Platform**: Google Meet  

If you sign up, please make sure you can attend the whole session, as we sell out quite quickly.
We will be using **Google Meet** for video, and **Padlet** for notes and comments. Please make sure you have a device that can access these, as some organisation’s firewalls block these platforms.

We hope to see you there!
