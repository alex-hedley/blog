## Talks

_Michael Stephenson_ - **Real World Journey Of Saving Lots Of Money In Azure**

_Adam Parker_ - **Interoperability In .NET Languages**

### Talk 1: Real World Journey Of Saving Lots Of Money In Azure

_Description_:

In this talk, we will talk about how I worked with a customer last year where we were trying to keep a tight control on our azure costs in our integration team and how we looked at implementing the same approaches in the wider organization.

We found a huge amount of waste in the azure spend and we will look at some of the things we found and approaches to optimize and reduce cost. We identified over $1m worth of cost savings.

_Speaker Bio_:

Michael Stephenson has worked as an architect on Azure projects for over 10 years developing enterprise solutions with Azure. Many of these solutions involve complex integration scenarios and discussing the advantages and disadvantages for a given use case for technologies like Logic Apps, Functions, Data Factory, Service Bus and others.
